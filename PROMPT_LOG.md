**Prompt:**
Read PROJECT.md and PROGRESS.md first.

Bug: The Sanity Studio is mounted in this Next.js app and is served at /studio, but loading mandakini-website.vercel.app/studio shows "Tool not found: studio". The Studio shell loads (Structure and Vision appear) but the default route fails to resolve.

Investigate and fix:
1. Check sanity.config.ts (or sanity.config.js) and confirm basePath is set to '/studio'.
2. Check the Next.js route folder that mounts the Studio (likely app/studio/...). Confirm it uses an OPTIONAL catch-all segment named exactly [[...tool]] (double brackets), NOT a single catch-all [...tool] or a plain [tool]. A non-optional or wrongly named segment is the most likely cause: the path segment is being captured and treated as a tool name, producing "Tool not found".
3. Ensure the route file correctly imports and renders the Studio with the shared config, and that basePath in the config matches the /studio mount point exactly.

Fix the mismatch so that visiting /studio loads the default Structure view with no "Tool not found" error.

Constraints:
- Do NOT modify any schemas, document types, fields, or unrelated config.
- Do NOT change CORS settings or environment variables.
- Only touch the Studio route file and sanity.config if needed.

On completion: report exactly what was misconfigured and what you changed, then update PROGRESS.md (Studio route fixed: /studio loads correctly) and append this prompt to PROMPT_LOG.md.
